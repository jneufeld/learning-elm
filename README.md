# Learning Elm

A reposity of selected exercises from the Elm track on [Exercism](https://exercism.org).

I previously used Elm on a [hobby project](https://github.com/jneufeld/sidearm).
Unfortunately, I felt burned out by work shortly before finishing. I'd like to
complete that project and learn more Elm.
